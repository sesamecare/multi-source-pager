# multi-source-pager

Sometimes you need to join multiple remote data sources (such as external APIs) together into one list and support paging. multi-source-pager provides a class that manages these multiple streams and exposes a cursor-based paging interface to clients.

Currently, the module only supports "forward" paging, additional work is required to go backwards.
